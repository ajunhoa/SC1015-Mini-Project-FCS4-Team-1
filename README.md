# SC1015 - Predicting HDB resale flat prices in Singapore
This repository contains the project files for the our mini project which aims to predict HDB resale flat prices in Singapore, based on this dataset:
[Resale Flat Prices from January 2017 onwards](https://beta.data.gov.sg/collections/189/datasets/d_8b84c4ee58e3cfc0ece0d773c8ca6abc/view)<br>

## Introduction
<a name="prob"></a>

### Problem Statement
- How do we predict the price

Our Question: Does Being Unconventional Determine Success?

Success: Determined using Salary and Job Satisfaction
Unconventional Individuals: Outliers/anomalies found after clustering individuals based on the technologies they use such as Web frameworks, Programming languages, Operating systems, etc.

Rationale: We believe that this dataset as well as the question we pose is very relevant to the SCSE community at NTU. Being students of SCSE, once we graduate, we might become developers ourselves. By learning what kinds of developers tend to be more successful, we might be able to understand what it takes to be successful in the software development world.
