This repository contains the project files for the our mini project which aims to predict HDB resale flat prices in Singapore, based on this dataset:
[Resale Flat Prices from January 2017 onwards](https://beta.data.gov.sg/collections/189/datasets/d_8b84c4ee58e3cfc0ece0d773c8ca6abc/view)<br>

## Introduction
<a name="prob"></a>

### Problem Statement
Through this project, we aim to solve a common problem that is faced by Singaporean Couples who intend to purchase a Resale flat from the HDB open market. 



Our success metric is determined through accuracy of predicted HDB resale flat price

Through our project, we hope to provide a platform for potential homeowners to seek their dream home.

## Data Driven Insights, Conclusion & Recommendations


### Limitations of this model
Purchasing a flat in Singapore often include factors that are intangible. These factors are often directly related to the buyer of the flat. 
Some factors could include:
- Distance from a Primary School that a parent is intending to enroll their child in, with prices near famous Primary schools increasing due to the demand. 
- Distance from an MRT, with prices increasing significantly the nearer a flat is to the MRT.
